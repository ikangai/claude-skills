"""Stop hook: keep an agent alive until the *team* is done, not just its slice.

Order of business when Claude tries to stop:

1. **Unanswered @mention?** Block and hand the messages back so the agent
   replies. Answering a teammate always wins — never wait while owing a reply.
2. **Nothing pending?** Trying to stop with an empty inbox *is* the "my slice is
   done" signal, so we mark this agent ``done``.
3. **Team barrier.** If every active agent is done, allow the stop — the whole
   team tears down together. Otherwise **park**: block in a sleep-poll loop so
   the finished agent stays alive (dormant, ~0 tokens) and can still receive a
   teammate's later @mention.

The park loop runs a bounded window (< the Stop hook ``timeout``) then returns a
cheap "still waiting" re-park block; Claude spends one trivial turn and re-parks.
A hard ceiling (``MAX_PARK_SECONDS``) releases a forever-parked agent so a
mis-set team size can't hang everyone.

Loop safety: the blocking *sleep* is what prevents a tight spin, so we gate on
the **barrier**, not on ``stop_hook_active``. Everything is wrapped to fail open.
